We can go with a folder structure

src - components and pages 
but for a bigger app it becomes hard to manage like that where folders with couple of subfolders

So we will split logic by features so feature related comps and pages are added
pages can be names container - bcz there can be lot of state management logic in them

shared folder for general comps not really belong to specific features
